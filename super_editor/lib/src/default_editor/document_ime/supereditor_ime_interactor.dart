/// [SuperEditor] interactor that edits a document based on IME input
/// from the operating system.
// TODO: instead of an IME interactor, try defining more granular interactors, e.g.,
//       TextDeltaInteractor, FloatingCursorInteractor, ScribbleInteractor.
//       The concept of the IME is so broad in functionality that if we mimic that
//       concept, we're going to get stuck piling unrelated behaviors into one place.
//       To make this division of responsibility possible, each of those interactors
//       could receive a proxy TextInputClient, which allows each interactor to say
//       proxyInputClient.addClient(myFocusedClient).
